When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When you want other people to contribute, or when you are planning to work from different computers

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Porque podría interferir con lo que se está programando localmente en ese momento
